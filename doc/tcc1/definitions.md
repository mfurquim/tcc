# Definitions

## Perfect and complete information
A complete extensive-form representation specifies:

1. The players of a game
1. For every player, every oportunity they have to move
1. What each player can do at each of their moves
1. What each player knows for every move
1. The payoffs received by every player for every possible combination of moves

## Imperfect information

**Information set** is a set of decision nodes such that:

1. Every node in the set belongs to one player
1. When play reaches the information set, the player with the move cannot differentiate between nodes within the information set

In extensive forme, an information set is indicated by a dotted line connecting all nodes in that set or sometimes a loop drawn around all the nodes in that set
A game with **perfect information** is such that at any stage of the game, every player knows exactly what has taken place earlier in the game. Any game without perfect information has **imperfect information**.

## Incomplete information

If the player does not know exactly what the payoffs of the game are or of what type his opponents are, it is meant an **incomplete information** game.

James Waldegrave was the first person to discuss what would become game theory in a 1713 letter concerning the card game le Her.

The first known discussion of game theory ocurred in a letter written by James Waldegrave in 1713. In this letter, Waldegrave provides a minimax mixed strategt solution to a two-person version of the card game le Her.

It was not until the publication of Antoine Augustin Cournot's researches into the mathematical principles of the theory of wealth in 1838 that a general game theoretic analysis was pursued. In this work Cournot considers a duopoly and presents a solution that is a restricted version of the **Nash equilibrium**

Although Cournot's analysis is more general than Waldegrave's, game theory did not really exist as a unique field until John von Neumann published a series of papers in 1928. While the french mathematician Borel did some earlier work on games, von Neumann can righfully be credited as the inventor of game theory.

James Waldegrave provided the first known mixed strategy solution of a matrix game. It was related to the game _le Her_ and described in Waldegrave's letter to Pierre Rémon de Montmort date on November 13, 1713. Let us briefly mention that the game _le Her_ is played by two people, usually named Peter and Paul. It begins when Peter deals Paul a single card at random from an ordinary deck of cards (ace, two,..., king), then deals a single card to himself; neither player sees the card dealt to the other one. The objecive of the game is to hold the card of the higher value than the opponent. If Paul is not satisfied with the card dealt to him, he may force Peter to exchange with him, with the exception that Peter has a king. If Peter is not satisfied with the card that he holds afterwards, he is permitted to exchange it for a card dealt from the deck at random; if the new card is a king, he must retain his original card. Then the two players compare cards and the one with the higher card wins. If both players hold cards of the same value, then Peter wins.

The game _le Her_ was already investigated by de Montmort and Nicholas Bernoulli in their mutual correspondence in 1713. They came to the conclusion that Paul should change every card less than 7 and hold all higher than 7, Peter should change card less than 8 and hold all higher than 8. In disputable cases, Bernoulli thought both should change, de Monmort believed that no precept could be given.

James Waldegrave was looking for a strategy that maximizes the probability of player's win, whichever strategy was chosen by the opponent, that is, exactly in the sense of today _minimax principle_. He came to the following mixed strategy solution formulated in terms of black and white chips: Paul should choose the strategy "change 7 and lower" with the probability 5/8 and the strategy "hold 7 and higher" with the probability 3/8; Peter should choos the strategy "change 8 and lower" with the probability 3/8 and the strategy "hold 8 and higher" with the probability 5/8.

Although de Montmort published the correspondence related to _le Her_, including Waldegrave's solution, in an appendix to the second edition of the book [21], Waldegrave's solution remained almost unnoticed for a very long time.
