The Game Theory field studies the best strategies of players where there is a conflict situation.
This paper utilizes the minimax theorem to solve some reduced versions of a game called \emph{Big Points}.
Its goal is to investigate whether the game is well balanced.
The game was simplified regarding its pieces' quantities and some specific types of pieces..
Using the memoization technique, we implemented two functions to separate the game's logic from the dynamic programming's logic.
After writting the code, execute it, and compile the results into a tridimensional bar plot, the results suggest that the complete game of \emph{Big Points} might not be balanced after all.
